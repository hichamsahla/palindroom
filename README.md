palindroom


Project Background:

The goal of this project was to create an form that uses Javascript to determine if the word u typed a palindrome is
experience:

it was tricky at first because it was hard to know on what u should base ur code on .
on which letters on how many letters but when I figured
that out it was not hard to finish it.
